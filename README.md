# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data---Course-Project

This is a repo for the Course project of Getting and Cleaning Data under the Data Science Specialization of Coursera. The task of the project is to create a tidy data set from the [data] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The code assumes that all the data required is in the folder/working directory.The main R script "run_analysis.R" can be directly launched. It analyses and performs all the steps as required to get the tidy data as the output. The output can be viewed in "avg_data.txt".

It also houses the Codebook.md file which describes all the variables, data and the transformations performed on the raw data.
